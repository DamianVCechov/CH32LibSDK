 * Description:
 * FastTinyDriver is an optimized graphics driver designed to work with 
 * ATtiny85 microcontrollers, particularly for the Tinyjoypad game console. 
 * This file contains the OLED driver code used in games developed for 
 * the ATtiny85. Although it is an integral part of each game code, 
 * FastTinyDriver is also designed to be used in other projects 
 * that require an OLED display based on the SSD1306 controller.
 *
 * This code is based on general knowledge of I2C programming and 
 * standard SSD1306 commands, as specified in the datasheet.
 *

 *
 * **IMPORTANT NOTE**: If this code is to be used for purposes other than the Tinyjoypad ATtiny85, 
 * it is imperative to remove the #define TINYJOYPAD_ASM_DRIVER to use the portable version 
 * of FastTinyDriver. Failing to do so may cause issues.
 *
 * for TINY JOYPAD rev2 (attiny85)
 * the code work at 16MHZ internal
